        <br /><br />
        Wovvo Inc. (&quot;Wovvo&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, or &quot;us&quot;) is committed to responding promptly and responsibly to valid legal complaints regarding content appearing on or accessible through our website and services, including but not limited to copyright infringement claims made under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and similar international copyright protection laws.
        <br /><br />
        Wovvo is a Canadian corporation organized under the laws of the Province of British Columbia and operates the web-based platform www.wovvo.ai (the &quot;Platform&quot;), which functions as a curated aggregator of publicly available hyperlinks related to creative, content-based, and freelance job opportunities hosted on external third-party platforms. We do not host, replicate, distribute, or cache original job listings or protected content on our servers.
        <br /><br />
        This DMCA &amp; Content Removal Policy describes how to notify us about potentially infringing material and outlines our process for review, action, and resolution. By using our Platform, you acknowledge and agree to the terms of this Policy.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>1. Statement of Non-Host Status & Aggregator Role</strong><br />
        Wovvo Inc. does not host, upload, or store third-party content. All external listings referenced on the Platform are publicly available and hyperlinked directly to their original source URLs. Wovvo does not display, embed, download, or mirror the full contents of any job listings or intellectual property from third-party sites.
        <br /><br />
        As a result:<br />
        We are not the publisher of any third-party content appearing at linked destinations.<br />
        We do not have editorial control over the content hosted on external websites.<br />
        We make no representations regarding the legality, accuracy, or authenticity of third-party materials linked via our Platform.<br />
        Notwithstanding the above, Wovvo is committed to ensuring that our Platform is not misused to facilitate infringement of intellectual property rights and will act in good faith to review and respond to valid content removal requests.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>2. Submitting a DMCA Notice</strong><br />
        If you are a copyright holder (or an authorized agent thereof) and believe that your copyrighted work has been linked to in a manner that constitutes copyright infringement, you may submit a written DMCA takedown notice to our Designated Agent at the email address listed below.
        <br /><br />
        Your notice must include the following:<br />
        Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.<br />
        The exact URL(s) on our Platform where the allegedly infringing link appears.<br />
        A description of how the content infringes your copyright.<br />
        A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that:<br />
        You are the rightful owner or authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyrighted work; and<br />
        The use of the material complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.<br />
        Your full legal name, mailing address, telephone number, and email address.<br />
        An electronic or physical signature of the copyright owner or authorized representative.<br />
        Incomplete or invalid notices will not be processed. Submitting a false claim may result in legal liability under Section 512(f) of the DMCA and/or other applicable copyright laws.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>3. Designated Copyright Agent</strong><br />
        All DMCA notices and copyright complaints should be sent to Wovvo’s Designated Agent at:<br />
        Email: <a className="font-bold" href="mailto:team@wovvo.ai">team@wovvo.ai</a><br />
        Subject Line: DMCA Takedown Request<br />
        Please do not send attachments unless requested. All notices must be submitted in English.

        <strong>4. Review and Response Procedure</strong><br />
        Upon receipt of a valid DMCA takedown notice, Wovvo will promptly:<br />
        Acknowledge the receipt of the notice within 10 business days.<br />
        Review the alleged material and verify that it is accessible via a Wovvo-provided link.<br />
        Determine whether the content resides on a third-party platform or in violation of our Platform’s usage terms.<br />
        Disable or remove access to the relevant link or listing from the Platform if the claim is valid.<br />
        If the content is hosted externally, Wovvo will refer the copyright holder to the host platform (e.g., LinkedIn, Twitter, Upwork) for direct takedown actions.
        <br />
        Wovvo is not obligated to notify the third-party platform or its users, nor are we required to engage in disputes involving external parties once a valid notice is processed.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>5. Counter-Notice Procedures</strong><br />
        If you believe a link or reference has been removed or disabled in error, you may submit a Counter-Notice to our Designated Agent, including the following:<br />
        Identification of the content that was removed and the location at which it appeared before removal.<br />
        A statement under penalty of perjury that you believe the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification.<br />
        Your name, address, phone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the courts in British Columbia, Canada.<br />
        Your physical or electronic signature.<br />
        Upon receipt of a valid Counter-Notice, Wovvo may reinstate the content or link within 10 to 14 business days, unless the original claimant files legal action seeking a court order to restrain such reinstatement.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>6. Repeat Infringer Policy</strong><br />
        Wovvo reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to suspend or terminate the accounts or access of any user who is determined to be a repeat infringer of intellectual property rights. This includes multiple complaints over time that are substantiated by valid takedown requests. Wovvo may, but is not obligated to, provide notice prior to termination.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>7. Limitation of Liability</strong><br />
        To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Wovvo Inc., its directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, and affiliates shall not be liable for:<br />
