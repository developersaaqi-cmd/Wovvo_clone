                <strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 21, 2025
                <br />
                <br />
                This Terms and Conditions of Use Agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) is entered into between you, the user (&quot;you,&quot; &quot;User,&quot; or &quot;Contributor&quot;), and Wovvo Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada (&quot;Wovvo,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; &quot;our,&quot; or &quot;us&quot;). This Agreement governs your access to and use of the Wovvo software platform, accessible via www.wovvo.ai (the &quot;Platform&quot;).
                <br />
                <br />
                By accessing, using, or purchasing any service through the Platform, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree to these terms, you must not use or access the Platform.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>1. Platform Overview</strong>
                <br />
                Wovvo is a digital platform that aggregates and curates links to publicly available job listings related to user-generated content (UGC). The Platform provides users with a streamlined dashboard interface that allows for easier discovery of paid creative opportunities that are hosted on external platforms. Wovvo does not host, own, or operate any of the jobs it links to and is not a hiring agency, job board, or employment broker.

                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>2. Membership and Access</strong>
                <br />
                Users may obtain access to the Platform through the purchase of membership tiers currently referred to as “Core Crew” or “Forever Founder.” Membership provides access to tools, filters, and link discovery features. Access is granted on a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable basis, solely for the individual use of the purchaser. You are prohibited from sharing, reselling, sublicensing, or otherwise redistributing your access to any third party.
                <br />
                <br />
                You may not copy, replicate, extract, reverse-engineer, frame, scrape, or index any portion of the Platform, its design, or underlying code. Any violation of these terms may result in immediate termination of access without refund and may subject you to civil liability.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>3. Payments and Refund Policy</strong>
                <br />
                All payments to Wovvo for access to the Platform, including any membership tier, are final and non-refundable. By making payment, you acknowledge that you are purchasing access to a digital service and that no refunds, credits, or reversals will be issued under any circumstance, including but not limited to dissatisfaction, changes in platform features, or technical issues.
                <br />
                <br />
                Pricing is listed in United States Dollars (USD) unless explicitly stated otherwise. You further agree not to initiate chargebacks or payment disputes against Wovvo Inc. without cause. Doing so constitutes a breach of this Agreement.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>4. No Guarantee of Job Results or Opportunities</strong>
                <br />
                Wovvo does not guarantee that any user will receive work, income, or offers of employment from opportunities linked through the Platform. Listings are sourced from publicly available content and are not under the control of Wovvo. We make no representation as to the accuracy, relevance, legitimacy, or availability of any third-party listing. You agree that your use of the Platform is for informational and research purposes only and that any job-related outcomes are solely your responsibility.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>5. Non-Transferability of Membership</strong>
                <br />
                Memberships, including both annual and lifetime tiers, are assigned to the original purchaser and may not be transferred, gifted, sold, or reassigned to any other person or entity. Any attempt to do so will result in immediate termination of access without refund.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>6. Intellectual Property Rights</strong>
                <br />
                All content and materials contained within the Platform—including but not limited to its branding, structure, user interface, features, logic, filters, and code—are the exclusive property of Wovvo Inc. or its licensors. Any unauthorized reproduction, distribution, or modification of the Platform or its contents is strictly prohibited and may result in legal action.

                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>7. Third-Party Content and Aggregation Disclaimer</strong>
                <br />
                Wovvo aggregates outbound hyperlinks to publicly available job opportunities hosted on third-party platforms. We do not host, display, or store the content of job listings. No proprietary job information, employer contact details, or third-party platform content is saved or cached by Wovvo. All job listings linked through the Platform redirect users to their original external source.
                <br />
                <br />
                Wovvo is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or partnered with any third-party platform, including but not limited to LinkedIn, Upwork, Threads, Twitter/X, Backstage, Meta, or any other job source. All trademarks, service marks, and intellectual property referenced belong to their respective owners.
                <br />
                <br />
                Wovvo makes no claim of ownership over any third-party job listing, nor do we facilitate communications or transactions between users and third-party employers. All job applications must be submitted directly through the original posting platform, and no outreach or client contact should be made through Wovvo.
                <br />
                <br />
                Users are prohibited from using the Platform to contact employers outside the intended third-party channels or to extract contact information for commercial use. Any misuse of Platform links, including bypassing third-party systems, will constitute a material breach of this Agreement.

                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>8. Limitation of Liability and Indemnity</strong>
                <br />
                To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to release, defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Wovvo Inc., its owners, directors, employees, contractors, agents, partners, affiliates, licensors, and service providers from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, legal actions, costs, or expenses arising from or related to your use of the Platform, your reliance on any listing, or your conduct relating to third-party platforms or listings.
                <br />
                <br />
                In no event shall Wovvo Inc. be liable for any indirect, incidental, punitive, exemplary, or consequential damages of any kind, including but not limited to lost profits, loss of opportunity, business interruption, or loss of data. The total aggregate liability of Wovvo Inc. shall not exceed the amount paid by you for your membership or access to the Platform.

                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>9. Platform Modifications and Termination</strong>
                <br />
                Wovvo Inc. reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Platform at any time, including but not limited to features, access tiers, dashboard components, membership terms, and pricing structures. You acknowledge that Wovvo is under no obligation to maintain any specific feature or access level indefinitely.

                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>10. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</strong>
                <br />
                This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of British Columbia and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein. Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Vancouver, British Columbia.
